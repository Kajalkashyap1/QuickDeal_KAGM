# QuickDeal: A College Marketplace

QuickDeal is a dynamic online marketplace designed specifically for college communities, providing a platform for students and faculty to buy, sell, and trade items within their campus network. Built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, QuickDeal offers a range of features to facilitate smooth transactions and interactions within the college community.

## Key Features

1. **Real-Time Chat**: Enable users to initiate and participate in real-time chat conversations to negotiate deals or discuss listings with other users.

2. **Auction**: Incorporate auction functionality for specific items, allowing users to bid with features like starting bids and bid increments. Real-time email updates keep users informed on ongoing auctions.

3. **Wishlist**: Allow users to create and manage a wishlist of items they are interested in purchasing. Users can add/remove items from the wishlist and view wishlist details.

4. **My Ads**: Provide users with a dedicated section in their dashboard to manage their listings and advertisements. Users can easily edit, delete, or renew their listings from this section.

5. **Signup & Login**: Implement options for users to login with their registered G Suite IDs or sign up if they are new users. Google Sign-In ensures seamless registration and authentication.

6. **Search & Filter**: Implement a robust searching mechanism where users can enter keywords to search for specific items. Additionally, provide options for filters such as categories with checkboxes to refine search results.

7. **Sell & Buy**: Create a user-friendly platform for buying and selling items. Sellers can create listings with details like title, description, price, and images. Buyers can browse listings, view item details, and make purchases directly through the platform.

8. **Notification**: Implement a notification system to keep users informed about important events such as new messages, bid updates, and listing status changes.
